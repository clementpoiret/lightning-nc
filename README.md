# Lightning Neural Compressor

The whole goal of this project is to provide [Pytorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai) callbacks use [IntelÂ® Neural Compressor](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor).

These callbacks aim at compressing a neural network so that it can be used on edge devices (i.e. mobile phones, raspberry pi, etc.).
This project is a work in progress and is not ready for production use.

## Current Status

I am currently working on it and will start with Quantization Aware Training, as the default callback has been deleted from Pytorch Lightning.
